  "body": "# HILAB - HBV\r\nThis is the first version of the unified HBV model version at UNESCO-IHE. The code is developed under the umbrella of the [Hydroinformatics Laboratory](https://hilab.unesco-ihe.org/) at [UNESCO-IHE](https://www.unesco-ihe.org). Currently the model is only implemented in Matlab. Implementation in other languages are foreseen in the near future.\r\n\r\nThis folder contains the model routines\r\n - precipitation module (precipitation)\r\n - Snow module (snow)\r\n - soil moisture module (soil)\r\n - response module (response)\r\n - routing module (routing)\r\n \r\nThe model is integrated by single time steps (`step_run.m`).\r\nTo simulate a complete time series, he `simulate.m` file, can be used.\r\nA running example of use is provided in `sample_run.m`\r\n\r\n## To do:\r\n\r\n- Code debugging and testing\r\n- Add performance metrics\r\n- Add automatic calibration\r\n- Add sensitivity analysis\r\n- Add data assimilation\r\n- Add error corrector\r\n",
